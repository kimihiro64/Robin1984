# Checked addressed dyadic frontiers

An inductive tree makes coverage structural. A flat list of paths is convenient
for untrusted search, serialization, and parallel replay. This module connects
the two with a small checker that reconstructs a tree and accepts only its exact
canonical leaf list. Acceptance certifies that the decoded paths form a complete
binary cover; correspondence between those paths and any external proof or
evaluation records must be maintained by the producer of those records.
